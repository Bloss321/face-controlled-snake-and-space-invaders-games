* bullet frenzy: nod head up and down
* shield: shake head left & right
* dash/boost: extreme tilting of head
* shoot lasers: smiling/opening mouth
* as time goes by, increase the speed of the aliens



all I want from the mediapipe tracker is the tilt (right now):
I can create a mediapipe tracker class with a direction global variable that is constantly updated?
extreme tilting to speed up the movement fo the player rocket


SPACE INVADERS:
- extreme head tilting to speed up the movement of the player's rocket (dash/boost function)
- as time goes by, increase speed of aliens
 - laser: open mouth (laser frenzy by squinting eyes?)

- smiling, raising eyebrows or open mouth
- probably choose smiling & open mouths
