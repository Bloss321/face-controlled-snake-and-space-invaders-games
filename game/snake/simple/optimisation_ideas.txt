To optimise the simple snake game:


* should the calibration process and face tracking game control use the same windows?
* mediapipe window & pygame window should open & close simultaneously
* can I place the mediapipe window & pygame window in the same window



* when the player hits the boundary their game ends, but I shouldn't reload the entire window, just:
- reset player score to 0
- update the result metrics with game failed as well as their score
- display game failed window briefly
- don't reset timer



TO SAVE TIME

SNAKE:
- for now: yaw & pitch for movements
- optimise as much as possible
- increase the speed of the snake by 0.1 each time a second passes
- use the same opencv window throughout process
- when failed, don't restart game:
  - set score to 0
  - set all the class attributes to orignal values
  - count the failures in a list that isn't cleared
  - have a quick message appear on the screen (game failed)
  - keep timer going
  - update result metrics
- prettify mediapipe facial landamrks output
- mediapipe and pygame should run sychronously & quit simultaneously
- can I do something about the frame rate?
- calibration process first, then give user time to start themselves
  - have a start game button, for when user is ready
- place mediapipe and pygame windows in same window
  - have the window appear at forefront of screen
  - window should always be in front of other windows on the screen
