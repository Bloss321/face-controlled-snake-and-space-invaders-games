1. game Initialization Test - Ensure that the game initializes correctly, including setting up the game window, snake, food, and game state.
2. head Movement Detection Test - Verify that the game accurately detects head movements using Mediapipe.
3. snake Movement Test - Test that the snake moves in the correct direction based on head movements detected by Mediapipe.
Food Consumption Test: Confirm that the snake grows when it consumes food and that new food appears in a different location.
Collision Detection Test: Ensure that the game properly detects collisions between the snake's head, its body, and the game boundaries.
Game Over Test: Verify that the game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game boundaries.
Score Calculation Test: Test that the score increases when the snake consumes food and that the score resets when the game restarts.
Game Reset Test: Check that the game resets correctly after a game over, including resetting the snake's position, length, and score.

what does the game do when there are multiple faces? -  which one will it choose? Make it robust to choose the closest person in view
- consider if the game words with cameras that record in different aspect ratios

Integration Tests:

Mediapipe and Pygame Integration Test: Ensure that Mediapipe correctly detects head movements and communicates them to the Pygame snake game for controlling the snake's movement.
Mediapipe and Pygame Error Handling Test: Test how the system behaves when there are errors or delays in Mediapipe's head movement detection and whether it affects the gameplay.
Gameplay Smoothness Test: Verify that the gameplay feels smooth and responsive, with no noticeable delays or lags between head movements and snake movement.
Mediapipe Calibration Test: Check if there's a need for calibration between Mediapipe and Pygame to ensure accurate control of the snake.
User Experience Test: Evaluate the overall user experience of controlling the snake using head movements and identify any usability issues or improvements needed.
Performance Test: Assess the performance of the game, including frame rate, CPU usage, and memory usage, to ensure it runs smoothly on different devices.
Compatibility Test: Test the game on different operating systems and hardware configurations to ensure compatibility and identify any platform-specific issues.
Boundary Testing: Test extreme cases, such as rapid head movements or prolonged periods of inactivity, to ensure the game handles them gracefully without crashing or freezing.

algorithm efficiency tests:
1. test the speed of the different algorithms & output in text file
2. test the latency of the different algorithms
3. test whether the face tracking algorithms work in 3-5 light levels: dark - bright
4. test gpu consumption (resource usage)
5. test cpu consumption
6. accuracy test (false positives, false negatives)
7. robustness - check performance under challenging conditions:
   - different facial expressions
   - occlusion
   - partial face views
   - varying light conditions
8. multiple face tracking??
9. integration tests or considerations
   - consider ease of integration and compatibility of each library with game/application environment
   - python programming language
   - the operating system?
   - the development platform
   - pycharm
   - how good it is for face tracking
   - whether it's originally used for facial recognition or images rather than live tracking
   - API usability
   - documentation quality
   - communication support
10. scalability tests - increase resolution of input images or video streams
    - how well does performance scale with higher resolutions? Compare across different libraries
11. "in the wild" tests - real world scenarios
    - indoors vs outdoors
    - different camera setups
    - diverse user demographics
12. long term stability tests? - run each library for extended period to assess stability & reliability over time
    - monitor for memory leaks
    - monitor for performance degradation
    - monitor for crashes that may occur during prolonged usage
